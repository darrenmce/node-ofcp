In your forge (https://_username_.firebaseio.com/), under the Auth section you will need a Firebase Secret for a later step.

and your firebase security rules need to include the ofcp portion of (or just copy&paste the whole thing):

```
{
  "rules": {
    "ofcp" : {
      "$ofcpID": {
        ".write" : "auth.root == 'ofcp' && auth.write == true",
        ".read": "auth.root == 'ofcp' && auth.read == true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
./install.sh

then open your browser to the address/port you specified in the install script
